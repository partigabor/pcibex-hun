// Notes on Hungarian Experiment

# Experiment

## Design

- Show the 2 images (a and b) at the same time
- Show the sentence word by word (SPR)
- After the sentence, ask the participant to choose between the 2 images

## Record data

- RT of each word/region in the sentence
- RT of decision (from fixation time end to choice)
- Choice of image (a or b)
- Eye tracking data (gaze on regions, durations, etc.)

## Results and their interpretation

- What does the RT of each word/region tell us?
- What does the RT of decision tell us?
- What does the choice of image tell us?
- How do the RTs and choices relate to each other?
- What does the eye tracking data tell us...

# Literature

## Visual World Paradigm
- Almost exclusively used in speech processing studies with audio stimuli

## Self-paced reading

## Sentence comprehension / verification

## Sentence--picture verification

# TODO

## Counterbalancing

- shuffle vs rshuffle vs randomize
- hardcode shuffling of images

## Fillers

- Gender? Hungarian Å‘ (he/she)
- Noun phrases?
- Every one

Every kid climbs a tree
Minden gyerek egy fara maszott.
Minden gyerek fara maszott.
A kid climbed every tree

# Q&A

# Notes

adjunct
modification structure
super big model

2 sets.

1st is the generic masculine, no gender bias sentences, only checking verbal reference.

2nd one has gender, with male and femalse subjects, and we switch up.

verbs, self or other directed verbs

2 variable: 
1. verbal preference, 
2. gender preference,

if we change the gender or status of subjects, would the interpretation of the sentence change? examining verbal ambiguity
