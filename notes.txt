// Notes on Hungarian Experiment

# Experiment

## Design

- Show the 2 images (a and b) at the same time
- Show the sentence word by word (SPR)
- After the sentence, ask the participant to choose between the 2 images

## Record data

- RT of each word/region in the sentence
- RT of decision (from fixation time end to choice)
- Choice of image (a or b)
- Eye tracking data (gaze on regions, durations, etc.)

## Results and their interpretation

- What does the RT of each word/region tell us?
- What does the RT of decision tell us?
- What does the choice of image tell us?
- How do the RTs and choices relate to each other?
- What does the eye tracking data tell us...

# Literature

## Visual World Paradigm
- Almost exclusively used in speech processing studies with audio stimuli

## Self-paced reading

## Sentence comprehension / verification

## Sentence--picture verification

# TODO

## Counterbalancing

- shuffle vs rshuffle vs randomize
- hardcode shuffling of images

## Fillers

- Gender? Hungarian Å‘ (he/she)
- Noun phrases?
- Every one

2nd one has gender, with male and femalse subjects, and we switch up.

verbs, self or other directed verbs

2 variable: 
1. verbal preference,
